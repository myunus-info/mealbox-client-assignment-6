# Assignment-6

This is my sixth assignment in the Programming Hero Next Level Web Development course platform. I am very excited to share and describe my project with you.

This is a meal box management application that consists of four collections: One is user collection, another is meal collection, another is meal providers' collection and the other is order collection. The meal collection involves creating, fetching, updating and deleting meal/s operations. The order collection handles order management.

Here is the description of how I have set up my project environment, the technologies I have used, how to run and inspect the project.
